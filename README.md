# Pathways
A Predictive Enrollment Analytics Application

Collaborated with Borealis AI, RBC, Our team (Rita Wang, Rhepa Kamal, Grace Guo, and Vicki Wu) has developed a predictive analytics prototype application.  

The dataset we used for analytics is from the University of California's official website. (https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/fall-enrollment-glance)

We have implemented and compared the performance of various machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, and Adaboost. We found that linear regression has the best performance in this case.

We have Leveraged data cleaning and visualization by Python(Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to preprocess the dataset, uncover insights, and effectively communicate model findings.

We have developed a prototype application using the Figma design tool to assist students in enhancing their utilization of the relevant functionalities.

Thank you so much!
