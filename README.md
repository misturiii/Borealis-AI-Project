# Borealis-AI-Project
Forecasting Admission Rate
Our concept of the project is to predict the admission rate for student. And our porject name is Pathways. 
We have Ziyan Wang (Rita) from UofT, Rhepa Kamal, Ziqi Guo (Grace), and Weiqi Wu (Vicki) all from OCAD in our team. 

The dataset we used is from University of California's offical website. ( https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/fall-enrollment-glance )

We tried several machine learning models to predict the admission rate, which are linear regreesion, random forest, XGBoost, and Adaboost. We found that linear regression has the best performance in this case.

Moreover, We also visualize the data by using Excel, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Last but not least, we have an app mock up to help student to better use the function. Our goal in the beginning was made a real app for that, however, due the the time limited as well as the compatible reason. We decided to make a mock up to show how the app will looks like, but it is not a real app. 

This is the link to the mock up app: https://www.figma.com/proto/44jCQAkXI53bj9ZIFgBsO2/Borealis-AI----Predict-Admission-Rate-Mockup?node-id=946%3A3271&scaling=scale-down&page-id=801%3A3417&starting-point-node-id=946%3A3271&show-proto-sidebar=1
